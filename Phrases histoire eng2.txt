Once upon a time there was a small village. 
It was nestled between a dense forest and a towering mountain. 
A young girl named Lily lived there. 
She was known for her kindness and courage. 
She was always ready to help anyone in need despite her young age.
A mysterious creature began to terrorize the village one day. 
It was a dragon. 
The dragon was as tall as the mountain and as fierce as the forest. 
The villagers were terrified. 
They didn't know what to do. 
The dragon would swoop down from the mountain every day. 
It caused havoc and fear.
Lily saw the distress of her fellow villagers. 
She decided to do something. 
She remembered an old tale her grandmother had told her. 
It was about a dragon who was calmed by a beautiful melody. 
Lily had a beautiful voice. 
She decided to sing to the dragon.
The next day the dragon swooped down. 
Lily stood in the middle of the village. 
She began to sing. 
Her voice was clear and beautiful. 
It echoed through the mountains and forest. 
The dragon heard the melody. 
It began to calm down. 
It landed gently in front of Lily. 
It listened intently to her song.
Lily finished her song. 
The dragon was no longer fierce and terrifying. 
It bowed its head to her. 
From that day forward the dragon no longer terrorized the village. 
Instead it would come down from the mountain to listen to Lily's songs. 
This brought peace and harmony to the village.
Lily's courage and kindness saved her village. 
This proved that sometimes the mightiest problems can be solved with the simplest solutions. 
They all lived happily ever after.
The end.
